Sometimes, when you think your kernel developing skills are shit, make sure the rom you've carelessly modded to shit isn't the cause of the majority of issues
you thought were kernel-related.  This badboy is doing great, gonna have to test it on a fresh rom install soon to get a real idea of where it stands.  Sorry all
for my shitty commit capabilites, I do not have the patience or skill for git cherry-picking properly.  Peace out.
